I didn&#39;t see much in the way of ads, and the cover art isn&#39;t exactly the most enticing; I was too busy playing God of War and Call of Duty anyway. </p><p>Did I miss out? Maybe?</p><p>Having now played through the &quot;Story&quot; mode, I can say that it has some decent twitch gameplay, and some kickass music. I was definitely bouncing along to the tunes playing through each level, and they were pretty varied based on the content of each level. I cringed a <i>little bit </i>at the China level, but it&#39;s not anything majorly egregious. </p><p>Lack of actual story aside from what&#39;s provided in the manual was a bit of a surprise to me. Really the game is a series of very simple missions one at a time, and they literally all are just &quot;grab item, get to the exit&quot;. There&#39;s nothing here to make you think or remember the characters and their plights, just pure fast action shooting.</p><p>Speaking of characters, I was surprised to see the variety of characters. There are humans, robots, ducks... ducks? Yeah. In the story mode each level offers a choice between a male/female avatar, and the women definitely got more... attention... in their creation. I could imagine the ads of the day calling out the &quot;voluptuous vixens&quot; or something to that effect, to paint you a bit of a picture. That said, the character designs are pretty unique overall, and quite varied. Like I said there are literally ducks. It doesn&#39;t take itself very seriously is what I&#39;m saying here.</p><p>After I was done the Story mode it unlocked some challenge modes, which I played through and found to be surprisingly difficult at times. Getting 100 headshots on zombies in around a minute is pretty tough since you have to manually aim up and it becomes a matter of &quot;flicking&quot; your aim up with each shot. And there&#39;s a level where you have to kill 100 ducks, which I was for some reason expecting it to be like a duck shooting range or something, but it was literally just 100 AI enemies with a duck skin; people-sized Donald Ducks, complete with duck voices and everything.</p><p>And that&#39;s the thing I think about the game which has helped it stand the test of time, and remain popular to this day - the little things that make you smile are fairly constant. The gunplay is fast paced and feels good to play, the music is bumpin&#39;, and the graphics are nuanced and fun. It&#39;s a good game that seems to have accomplished what it set out to, it&#39;s fun!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="teleports"></div><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{CTF_HOST:"cdn.contentful.com",CTF_PREVIEW:false,CTF_SPACE_ID:"gxu1rby54im7",CTF_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN:"QcKy1gRlFJbtTFFOlx2Y4L5OcVUEAzkrFfCavtNUiTg"},app:{baseURL:"/",buildId:"2f16dce3-6d7b-4f60-81d7-04137cf66de1",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script>
