I won&#39;t bother writing further posts relating to that run as it&#39;s just playing on a harder difficulty with all of my unlocks preserved, suffice it to say that it&#39;s such an enjoyable experience that I don&#39;t want it to be over quite yet.</p><p>A remake in my mind takes the source material and elevates it. A graphical overhaul, maybe some extra details here and there. Dead Space does a phenomenal job of this, on par with the Shadow of the Colossus remake; it truly takes the original game and presents it in its entirety without drastic change, makes it looks modern and beautiful (gory!), and adds on a few side missions and quality of life updates. The side missions add to the story without retconning anything, and only one thing really was changed to a great degree - Isaac Clarke has a voice this time around!</p><p>When Dead Space 2 was announced to have a voice for the protagonist Isaac, many were worried it would not be great; the first Dead Space had a silent protagonist. But DS2 proved Isaac to be even more memorable than the first time around. The remake once again <i>elevates </i>this by many factors - the voice work is superb, Isaacs extra face time compared to the original is welcome, and nothing about it felt &quot;off&quot; at all. It was <i>so </i>natural that I was second-guessing the fact that the original <i>did </i>have a silent protagonist (it did!). Go back and watch the first ten minutes of both versions of the game for all you need to know; the original was no slouch at all, but the addition of a voice for Isaac is honestly a huge improvement.</p><p>This is the best version of one of the best games of all time, and I&#39;ll be replaying it many times I&#39;m sure.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="teleports"></div><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{CTF_HOST:"cdn.contentful.com",CTF_PREVIEW:false,CTF_SPACE_ID:"gxu1rby54im7",CTF_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN:"QcKy1gRlFJbtTFFOlx2Y4L5OcVUEAzkrFfCavtNUiTg"},app:{baseURL:"/",buildId:"2f16dce3-6d7b-4f60-81d7-04137cf66de1",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script>
