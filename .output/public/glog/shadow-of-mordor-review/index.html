It&#39;s probable that I was playing it during the last year or so of the time when I was really quite &quot;into&quot; trophies on the PlayStation Network, and I likely stopped simply for that some other game with faster to earn trophies came out, or the trophies weren&#39;t coming fast enough; it&#39;s possible I was only playing it for a specific trophy while participating in a contest on the PlayStation trophies forum. </p><p>Regardless of why I stopped playing the game the first time, I started it up again a few days ago to give myself a break from all the PC gaming I tend to do, to sit on the couch and relax a bit. I&#39;m glad I did, as I ended up liking the game a lot with this revisit. The combat takes inspiration from a number of sources, and I liken it much to the Batman Arkham series, though a fair bit more chaotic. I&#39;ve never really liked how in most games with many enemies surrounding a protagonist they tend to come at you one at a time, and this game does away with that for a system which has you often trying to cull the herd from afar or separate them with environmental effects. It&#39;s a nice mix which was frustrating at times, but a good change by my measure.</p><p>The story is non-canon, being inspired by and utilizing characters and locations from Tolkien&#39;s work, but without being a story Tolkien had written himself. That said, I felt it fit in pretty well with the existing lore. It was interesting following the existing characters, even if the protagonist was a tad bland himself. The ending was &quot;meh&quot;, and an obvious &quot;look forward to the next game!&quot;, but hey - I <i>do </i>look forward to the next game, so there&#39;s that.</p><p>Overall I&#39;m more looking forward to the sequel being (according to articles I&#39;ve read) a tighter experience. Something I missed about this game was the nemesis system; it&#39;s highly touted as one of the more innovative features, and I was really looking forward to it, but in the end I really didn&#39;t see it impacting much of the game at all. I only ended up seeing two Uruks in total come back to exact revenge, and my apparent &quot;true nemesis&quot; was one whom I&#39;d only actually ever seen twice through the game. I&#39;m hoping they did more with that in Shadow of War since it <i>is </i>an intriguing system which I was excited to partake in.</p><p>I liked the game a lot and will probably go straight into the sequel, something I don&#39;t do often. It&#39;s really fun and well put together, I want more!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="teleports"></div><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{CTF_HOST:"cdn.contentful.com",CTF_PREVIEW:false,CTF_SPACE_ID:"gxu1rby54im7",CTF_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN:"QcKy1gRlFJbtTFFOlx2Y4L5OcVUEAzkrFfCavtNUiTg"},app:{baseURL:"/",buildId:"2f16dce3-6d7b-4f60-81d7-04137cf66de1",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script>
