It's probable that I was playing it during the last year or so of the time when I was really quite \"into\" trophies on the PlayStation Network, and I likely stopped simply for that some other game with faster to earn trophies came out, or the trophies weren't coming fast enough; it's possible I was only playing it for a specific trophy while participating in a contest on the PlayStation trophies forum.

I'm glad I did, as I ended up liking the game a lot with this revisit. The combat takes inspiration from a number of sources, and I liken it much to the Batman Arkham series, though a fair bit more chaotic. I've never really liked how in most games with many enemies surrounding a protagonist they tend to come at you one at a time, and this game does away with that for a system which has you often trying to cull the herd from afar or separate them with environmental effects. It's a nice mix which was frustrating at times, but a good change by my measure.",[],{},{"nodeType":16,"data":32,"content":33},{},[34,38,44],{"nodeType":20,"value":35,"marks":36,"data":37},"The story is non-canon, being inspired by and utilizing characters and locations from Tolkien's work, but without being a story Tolkien had written himself.

Something I missed about this game was the nemesis system; it's highly touted as one of the more innovative features, and I was really looking forward to it, but in the end I really didn't see it impacting much of the game at all. I only ended up seeing two Uruks in total come back to exact revenge, and my apparent \"true nemesis\" was one whom I'd only actually ever seen twice through the game.
