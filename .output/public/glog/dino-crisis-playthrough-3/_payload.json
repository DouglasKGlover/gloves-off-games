It is able to shoot anesthetic or even lethal darts, both of which will knock out any dinosaur if not permanently at least long enough to quickly explore a room and then move on. Nearer to the end of the game I was tasked with turning on a generator and I chose the \"shoot my way through\" route, and I literally just one-shot killed every dino in my path with lethal darts I had saved up throughout the game.
