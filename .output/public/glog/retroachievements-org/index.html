Naturally, I&#39;ve gone all-in the past week and have &quot;Mastered&quot; (earned every achievement for...) 8 classic NES games so far. Ok they&#39;re not all &quot;classics&quot;, but they&#39;re the games I grew up with, damn it!</p><p>Here&#39;s a handy link to my profile, to check out my progress to date: <a href="https://retroachievements.org/user/Gloves" target="_blank">Gloves · RetroAchievements</a></p><p>As of writing I&#39;ve tried to play a handful of games in different genres: Shoot &#39;em ups, Action/Platforming, Arcade, and RPG.</p><p>Among those, the one that took the longest was, predictably, <b>Final Fantasy;</b> though there wasn&#39;t really anything particularly difficult about it (it helps that I&#39;ve played the game many times and am very familiar with it). Elevator Action was easily the hardest, as it gets insanely difficult on the &quot;last&quot; (fourth) level. The achievements are varied and there are some much much harder games out there to play, or incredibly simple and easy ones depending on what you&#39;re after. </p><p>I&#39;ve decided for now that I want to use the system to challenge myself, hence I&#39;ve &quot;Mastered&quot; all of the games I&#39;ve played so far. In for a penny, in for a pound! I want an excuse to get really into each game and this has been a solid way to do so. Interestingly, there are even extra &quot;Subsets&quot; of achievements which you can go for if you want to go the extra mile (or twenty) - stuff like speedrunning Super Mario Bros, or beating Final Fantasy with a solo White Mage (it can be done!). There&#39;s even &quot;sets&quot; of achievements for hacks, homebrews, and the like, they&#39;re very flexible and open to adding games to the system.</p><p>Speaking of adding to the system, it&#39;s impressive how far they&#39;ve come, and how active they continue to be. Apparently this all started in 2012 (how have I missed it this long!?), and they have an impressively huge list of consoles with achievements available. Just load up your favourite (supported) emulator, and get to playing. I counted up the systems that have achievements tied to the site and they&#39;re at precisely fifty right now, which is just astounding. So many options for people to play and show off their prowess and love for the old systems.</p><p>Good chance that I start setting up the &quot;Completed&quot; state on my site here to be tied to this site, where applicable. It&#39;s just so great that it works so well, I&#39;m loving it!</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="teleports"></div><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{CTF_HOST:"cdn.contentful.com",CTF_PREVIEW:false,CTF_SPACE_ID:"gxu1rby54im7",CTF_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN:"QcKy1gRlFJbtTFFOlx2Y4L5OcVUEAzkrFfCavtNUiTg"},app:{baseURL:"/",buildId:"2f16dce3-6d7b-4f60-81d7-04137cf66de1",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script>
