Cost me a fair bit of time revisiting rooms, but I landed back in a room with a dead guy I was supposed to come back to when I obtained a pair of keys and used them on a hidden wall safe. Doing so started a quick little fight with a T-rex, though it was quite easy. A few shotgun shells and he ran off.</p><p>Shortly after that I came across some pteranodons which were pretty easy to dodge, so no big deal.</p><p>Another two T-Rex fights as I progressed through, the latter of which was in an open space after the jerk took down my helicopter escape. </p><p>Shortly after THAT I came across what is easily the toughest enemy so far; I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re called but they have two claws on each hand and every step they take is <i>thunderous. </i>Very intimidating.</p><p>I like the puzzles well enough in the game so far. Nothing too crazy or obtuse, lots of word puzzles. Typical Resident Evil style jumping through hoops to get a key to open a door kinda stuff in general. Pretty fun.</p><p>I can probably finish the rest of the game off if I sit down and focus on it, based on the time to beat estimates online. I usually check out the howlongtobeat website before playing a game to get an idea of what I&#39;m in for. I might stop doing that though as if they say &quot;this is an 8 hour game&quot; and I&#39;m at what <i>seems </i>to be the end, I&#39;ll likely see a twist coming (as happened with the helicopter, as obvious as that was).</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="teleports"></div><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{CTF_HOST:"cdn.contentful.com",CTF_PREVIEW:false,CTF_SPACE_ID:"gxu1rby54im7",CTF_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN:"QcKy1gRlFJbtTFFOlx2Y4L5OcVUEAzkrFfCavtNUiTg"},app:{baseURL:"/",buildId:"2f16dce3-6d7b-4f60-81d7-04137cf66de1",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script>
