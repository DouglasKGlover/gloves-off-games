I always loved how you can enter a Mario 64 level and just kinda go for basically any star in the level (with some exceptions). It was a pretty early \"open world\" (almost) kinda game, with a ton of freedom. Galaxy unfortunately felt much more linear by comparison - upon entering a galaxy you'd choose a star to go for, and that was (more or less) the only star available to you. There are green stars which add some minor depth to that formula, and different shooting stars which travel between galaxies and make special stars available, but really it's still \"pick the star you want to get and get it\".
