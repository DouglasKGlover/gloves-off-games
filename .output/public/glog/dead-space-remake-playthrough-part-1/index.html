With that in mind, this remake has elevated it, and made me excited at the prospect of them also remaking the sequel (can do with or without a Dead Space 3 remake...). I can&#39;t really see me popping in the PS3 disc again in the future now that this version exists and that&#39;s said with nothing but love and praise for the original game.</p><p>If I was to be critical of the game I&#39;ve played thus far (about halfway through at time of writing), the sound design of the enemies could use a slight bit of tweaking. Dead Space has a tendency of dropping enemies both in front <i>and behind </i>you at the same time, and the enemies behind you can be difficult to detect via audio (grunts, growls, screams) since they&#39;re actually relatively silent. It could be argued that they&#39;re attempting to be stealthy and fair enough, though they clearly are closer to the lumbering braindead zombie type of enemy so stealth isn&#39;t something really quite so expected. Plus side, it&#39;s been a source of at least a few &quot;OH SHIT!&quot; freak out moments where an enemy I didn&#39;t know existed was suddenly hugging me from behind.</p><p>Also the sections without gravity can be difficult to navigate at times, especially with enemies being difficult to see. But it&#39;s a scary space game, who am I to complain? </p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="teleports"></div><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{CTF_HOST:"cdn.contentful.com",CTF_PREVIEW:false,CTF_SPACE_ID:"gxu1rby54im7",CTF_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN:"QcKy1gRlFJbtTFFOlx2Y4L5OcVUEAzkrFfCavtNUiTg"},app:{baseURL:"/",buildId:"2f16dce3-6d7b-4f60-81d7-04137cf66de1",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script>
