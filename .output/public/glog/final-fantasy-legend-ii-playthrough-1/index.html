I loved FF growing up and this game held a special place for me, it was a constant companion on my Game Boy (along with Final Fantasy Adventure, which I never got very far in). Car trips and hospital stays as a kid were more made bearable with this tiny world in my (Game Boy) Pocket.</p><p>Cliche remarks aside, I really do have a soft spot for this game, despite having never actually gotten all the way to the end before. I always get held up at a specific boss fight near the end of the game. I THINK I may have come close a few times, but close doesn&#39;t matter in a turn-based RPG - you beat em or you don&#39;t. I&#39;ve never followed any sort of guide so I truly do not know how close or far from beating that boss I may have been.</p><p>Now, older and perhaps a bit wiser, I&#39;ve decided to give the game another go with the hope of beating it at last. I&#39;ve put together my team of 2 Robots, a Mutant, and a Monster (Baby Dragon), and we&#39;ve set off. So far I&#39;ve cleared the first 2 worlds with ease, as is the custom with Robots in your party in this game. They&#39;re heavily item dependent for their stats, but they pack a huge punch if you stack them full of the good stuff without any need for grinding (aside from for money). I always loved the concept of eating enemy meat to transform your Monster characters, and I think a Mutant will do me well as a magic user, especially as a healer and AOE damage character.</p><p>I&#39;m having a good time with it, as ever. I&#39;ll probably hold off on updating on this playthrough further until I come up to that difficulty spike boss again, or otherwise anything interesting happens.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="teleports"></div><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{CTF_HOST:"cdn.contentful.com",CTF_PREVIEW:false,CTF_SPACE_ID:"gxu1rby54im7",CTF_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN:"QcKy1gRlFJbtTFFOlx2Y4L5OcVUEAzkrFfCavtNUiTg"},app:{baseURL:"/",buildId:"2f16dce3-6d7b-4f60-81d7-04137cf66de1",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script>
