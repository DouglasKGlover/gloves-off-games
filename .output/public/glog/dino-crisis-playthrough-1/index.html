We&#39;d all make a list of games we thought we could reasonably expect ourselves to get through in the year, try to do so, then at year&#39;s end see how we did.</p><p>I made <a href="https://www.videogamesage.com/forums/topic/6172-the-2021-backlog-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=148291" target="_blank">my list</a> with, as many do, the best of intentions - I sincerely wanted to make a decent attempt at each of the games! Work may have gotten in the way a few times, as well as a slight addiction to a certain MMO that I&#39;ve recently decided to go cold turkey on.</p><p>Having dropped the MMO, I can now focus my efforts on my backlog, and I decided (with some prompting) to play through <i>Dino Crisis</i>. I&#39;ve not played it before, but being a fan of the old Resident Evil games it seemed it&#39;d be right up my alley. So far it looks like I was right - the game is pretty similar, though perhaps a bit more action-oriented. The dinosaurs are fast-moving and so far primarily velociraptors, though more recently I&#39;ve run into some compsognathus, the tiny devils. The game gives two difficulty options from the outset - Normal (the default) and Easy; I&#39;m playing on Normal.</p><p>Something I&#39;ve not seen the end-result of yet but which I find very interesting is that I&#39;ve been given a choice already on what action to take - literally the game presented two options, one to support the mission-minded leader of my team and the other to answer a distress call along with my more emotion-driven and well-meaning cohort. I went with the team leader, potentially the &quot;bad&quot; route, but time will tell. I don&#39;t know that the game necessarily has good/bad so much as simply choices with outcomes; I&#39;m excited to find out!</p><p>I&#39;m a couple of hours in and the puzzles aren&#39;t difficult at all, and the traditional RE-style map is helpful in finding my bearings and keeping me on track. So far I&#39;ve been avoiding confrontations with the dinosaurs as best I can to conserve ammo and healing items, though it has so far lead to an abundance of both. I&#39;ve crafted a few instant-kill bullets and very useful anesthetic rounds for whenever I might actually need them. Perhaps in my next play session I&#39;ll have more need for the bullets I&#39;ve created.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="teleports"></div><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{CTF_HOST:"cdn.contentful.com",CTF_PREVIEW:false,CTF_SPACE_ID:"gxu1rby54im7",CTF_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN:"QcKy1gRlFJbtTFFOlx2Y4L5OcVUEAzkrFfCavtNUiTg"},app:{baseURL:"/",buildId:"2f16dce3-6d7b-4f60-81d7-04137cf66de1",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script>
