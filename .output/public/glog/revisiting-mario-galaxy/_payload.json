I have a little 10\" JVC which I typically play NES up to PS2 games on, and a while back I got an HDMI down-converter, wondering if I could plug in my PS4 to play some Arcade Archives games.

I've never beaten Galaxy before, the farthest I've gotten is 11 stars in total. The primary reason being that every time I pick it up I end up getting really bad motion sickness (VR games tend to do this to me as well). Galaxy has a terrible habit of flipping the view upside down for really no good reason at all, and I think paired with my really big TV in the living room with the low resolution of the game it just never meshed well for me.
