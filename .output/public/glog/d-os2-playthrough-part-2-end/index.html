Suffice it to say I completed the game, played on Classic, and really loved the whole experience. There were a few moments in the third of 4 chapters especially where I wanted to just move on to the next main story plot, and the final chapter had some similar moments (&quot;Ugh, really? Some random <i>spiders </i>are ambushing me?&quot;), but overall the combat is engaging enough to remain a constant challenge as long as you&#39;re not cheesing it. </p><p>I&#39;ve read some opinions/concerns online about Larian&#39;s approach with Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 potentially mirroring that of D:OS2 in that they&#39;ll demo the first chapter which will be <i>full </i>of content and then the rest of the game rushed and/or relatively empty/short, and I can somewhat see where those concerns might come from. Of the four chapters, the first was about 20% of the total gameplay, chapter two was a massive 50%, and the last two filled the rest with the third being over before I realized it. I won&#39;t say I did <i>everything</i>, but I certainly quested the heck out of chapter two especially as I was feeling a tad underleveled near the end of it and wanted to get more XP/levels before moving on.</p><p>The ending was more of a recap after speaking with my friends on our ship. I was more moved by the short conversations than the pre-credits cutscene, and none of it was particularly grand, which is fine I suppose. </p><p>Really the gameplay and the character interactions carried the game, in that order. I really loved the ability to respec my characters basically at will by going back to the ship, which encouraged experimentation. I kept everyone basically the same theme as intended by the game/story, with some minor adjustments and the typical attempts at unguided min/maxing. It was really engaging and I already want to play again on a higher difficulty and with a smaller party (the Lone Wolf perk being especially appealing sounding).</p><p>I really do highly suggest the game, it&#39;s beyond excellent. Has me super excited for the full release of Baldur&#39;s Gate 3 later this year.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div id="teleports"></div><script>window.__NUXT__={};window.__NUXT__.config={public:{CTF_HOST:"cdn.contentful.com",CTF_PREVIEW:false,CTF_SPACE_ID:"gxu1rby54im7",CTF_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN:"QcKy1gRlFJbtTFFOlx2Y4L5OcVUEAzkrFfCavtNUiTg"},app:{baseURL:"/",buildId:"2f16dce3-6d7b-4f60-81d7-04137cf66de1",buildAssetsDir:"/_nuxt/",cdnURL:""}}</script>
