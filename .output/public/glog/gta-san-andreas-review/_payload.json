There's some underutilized features like the gang territory thing (having to get to 35% to do the last mission makes story sense, but kinda felt shoe-horned in); I'd have liked to have seen that expanded to the entire map, might have been cool facing down triad gangs in Las Venturas or San Fierro, for instance.
